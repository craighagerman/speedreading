Texts should be around 500 words long and written within the 1000 or 2000 word frequency level. (ie. using only words within the 1000/2000 most frequently used words in English.) The point of this activity is to improve reading fluency, not reading for accuracy, guessing meaning from context, etc. 

For more information on the practice and benefits of speedreading as a fluency thread within an ESL / EFL class please read Paul Nation\'s writings on the topic. See his web page here:
